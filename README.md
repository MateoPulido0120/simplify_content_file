This project aims to process content (currently PDF) from plain text files, extracting important features from all the content. Its simplified or summarized generation is done from the conversation obtained between two ReAct (Reasoning and Actuation) agents, one of them with the role of teacher or expert on the subject and the other agent with the role of learner, so that Among them, questions and answers are asked about the specific topic that the document deals with and to be able to have a closer simulation of the true relevant content of the file.
